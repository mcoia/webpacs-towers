<a name="general"><h2>General Information</h2></a>

<a name="general1"><h3>What is Towers?</h3></a>
<p>Towers is a cluster or group of Missouri libraries, within the MOBIUS library consortium 
  (see below). The Towers Library Catalog is an on-line public access catalog, 
  including the collections of the following Missouri libraries: Conception Abbey, Missouri Western State University,
  National Heritage Military Museum, North Central Missouri College, Northwest Missouri State University. </p>
<p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

<a name="general2"><h3>What is MOBIUS?</h3></a>
<p>MOBIUS, also known as Missouri Bibliographic Information User System, 
  is a consortium of academic libraries with over fifty member colleges and universities 
  in the state of Missouri. The largest single project for which MOBIUS is responsible 
  is The Common Library Platform project. The CLP creates a virtual collection 
  of the approximately 14 million items in the libraries of Missouri's colleges 
  and universities and creates a single user interface that allows faculty and 
  students to request library materials using any personal computer in any location 
  with access to the Internet. Requested materials are delivered within one or 
  two days of being requested by the MOBIUS Delivery System. <a href="http://searchmobius.org/screens/about_mobius.html"
target="_blank">[more]</a> </p>
<p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

<a name="general3"><h3>When will I be able to REQUEST/borrow items from other 
  libraries?</h3></a>
<p>Patron Borrowing will be turned on at the cluster level on or about August 9, 2002
  to provide direct borrowing within libraries in the Towers cluster. The Towers 
  Library Catalog will be made available at the statewide (MOBIUS) level on or about October 9, 2002. </p>
<p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

<a name="general4"><h3>How long will I be able to keep books that I borrow?</h3></a>
<p>21 days for most items. You may renew each item once for 21 days if it is not needed 
  elsewhere.</p>
<p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

<a name="general5"><h3>How many books can I have out at one time?</h3></a>
<p>At the MOBIUS level undergraduates may have 10 items, faculty and graduate 
  students may have 20 items at one time. However, each library has its own limits 
  regarding total items checked out, so you should inquire at your local library.</p>
<p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>


<a name="search"><h2>Help with Searching</h2></a>

<a name="quicksearch"><h3>What does the Quick Search box do?</h3></a>

<p>The Quick Search box is a powerful tool for experienced users of the Towers Library Catalog. 
With it, you may quickly launch almost any kind of search, of any part of the Towers Catalog. 
Press the arrow at the end of the "Search by" box to see the types of searches you can perform. 
If you are not familiar with the Catalog, we suggest you look below the QuickSearch box and 
choose the link for an individual type of search (e.g. author, title, etc.).  
For each type of search, you will find search advice and examples to help you 
with your research.</p>

<p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p> 

<a name="search2"><h3>I got too many items with my search.</h3></a>

<p>Here are some ways that you can decrease the number of items you retrieve:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Do a Subject search instead of a keyword search.</b>  LC Subject searches cover a standardized list of terms and do not search other fields, such as author, note, etc.  Children's subject searches also can be used to search for specialized materials.
<br><br></li>
<li><b>Do a Title search instead of a keyword search.</b> Sometimes you can find a handful of books with titles that begin with your topic, e.g. Management.  As an alternative, you can type t: in front of a word to search for that word in the title of a work.  This should also produce fewer results than a keyword search.
<br><br>
<tt>t:France</tt> (finds materials with the word France anywhere in the title)
<br><br></li>
<li><b>Use the word And to do a keyword search on more than one concept.</b>  
The computer will look for items that mention <u>both</u> terms.
<br><br>
<tt>television and children</tt>
<br><br></li>
<li><b>Use the words And Not to omit certain keywords.</b>  The computer will look for items that mention the first term but omit any items that mention the second term after the Not.
<br><br>
<tt>South America And Not Brazil</tt>
<br><br></li>
 
<li><b>When viewing a record for an item you retrieved, check the "Subjects" field to find more
 specific headings/terms.</b>  Scroll down through the record for an item you retrieved until you see the Subject area.  Here you will find suggestions for other subject terms you may use.  A search on training, for example, will yield books on the narrower subjects given below:
<br><br>
<tt>Employees--Training of<br>
Teams in the workplace</tt><br>
<br><br></li>
<li><b>Use the Limit/Sort button to narrow to a particular publication year or years, 
material type, language, etc.  </b>
For example, you can have the computer rerun a search on World War II but limit the 
results to videotapes on the topic.</li>

</ol>

<p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

<a name="search3"><h3>I got too few items with my search.</h3></a>

<p>Here are some ways that you can increase the number of items you retrieve:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Do a Keyword search instead of a LC Subject or Children's Subject search.</b>
  A keyword search covers more fields, such as title, notes, etc.
<br><br></li>
<li><b>Use the word OR to search on variations of a concept.</b>  
To give the computer more choices, use OR to link two words with the same meaning or two words, either of which would satisfy your needs.
<br><br>
<tt>Amazon or Amazon.com<br>
Greek or Latin</tt>
<br><br></li>
<li><b>Use an asterisk* to truncate endings of words.</b>  Have the computer search for variations of a word by adding an asterisk.  For example, to search for either training or trainers or train, type:
<br><br>
<tt>train*</tt>
<br><br></li>
</ol>

<p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

<a name="search4"><h3>I didn't get anything!</h3></a>

<p>Here are some suggestions if your search gets zero results:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Check your spelling.</b>  Unfortunately, the computer won't do this for you.  You can use an asterisk * if you know at least part of a word.
<br><br>
<tt>Dostoevsk*</tt> (will find Dostoevsky or Dostoevskii)
<br><br>

If you want the computer to fill in more than 5 letters, use two asterisks:
<br><br>
 
<tt>totalit**</tt> (for a search on totalitarianism)
<br><br></li>
<li><b>Do a keyword search.</b>   This is the most general type of search you can do.
<br><br></li>
<li><b>Make sure you are doing the correct type of search.</b>  Trying to search for an author in the journal name field usually won't work.  Check that you have selected the correct type of search.
<br><br></li>
<li><b>Do a simple search on fewer keywords.</b>  Try simplifying your search by limiting the number of words you are stringing together with the word And.  For example, instead of personnel and training and computer-assisted instruction and evaluation, try the following:
<br><br>

<tt>computer-assisted instruction and evaluation<br>
training and computer-assisted instruction</tt>
<br><br>
<li><b>Try the search in the entire MOBIUS catalog to see if another library/cluster 
has the materials you want.</b>  It's possible that your library just doesn't own the 
materials you need.  Follow the link at the top of the screen to search the MOBIUS 
catalog or a catalog of another MOBIUS member or cluster.

<a name="search5"><h3>I want to limit my search but am confused by the "Material Type" options.</h3></a>

<p>Most of the material types are familiar ones, such as books, journals, maps, etc.  Some of the other ones are:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Thesis or Manuscript:</b> Thesis includes master's theses and doctoral dissertations.  Manuscripts may include authored works, correspondence and other documents related to an individual or group.  Manuscripts are often kept in separate collections.<br><br></dd>
<dd><b>Electronic Resource:</b> A resource such as a cd-rom, online database, etc.  As a rule, regular music cds are grouped under Audio, Music rather than Electronic Resource.  In addition, electronic books are grouped under the E-Book material type.<br><br></dd>
<dd><b>Video:</b> includes formats such as VHS, laserdisc, DVD, etc.<br><br></dd>
<dd><b>Archival Material:</b> Collections of documents, photographs, media, etc. that are the official records of an organization or institution.  Archival materials are usually kept in separate collections.</dd>

<a name="mark"><h2>Marking Records/Making Lists</h2></a>

<a name="mark1"><h3>I marked some records but I don't see the option to print or email my list.</h3></a>

<p>When you mark records, you must press the "Save Marked Records" button at the bottom of each page.  If you leave a page without pressing this button, your marks will disappear.  Once you have saved your marked records, you will see a button in the button bar which allows you to Email/Save/Print your list.</p>

<p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

<a name="mark2"><h3>How can I print/download/email a list of items from the catalog?</h3></a>
<ol>
<li>Do a search and have the search results on your screen.</li>
<li>Place a check mark in the box called "Mark" beside each item you want.</li>
<li>Press the Save Marked Records button at the bottom of the page.</li>
<li>Continue to mark and save records on subsequent pages.</li>
<li>When ready to retrieve your list, press the Email/Save/Print button on the button bar.</li>
<li>The screen that appears will provide options for emailing or saving the list.  You may also display it on your screen and print it out.</li>

<a name="view"><h2>Viewing Your Results/Locating Materials</h2></a>

<a name="view1"><h3>How do I know which library owns the book I need?</h3></a>

<p>When you do a search and view the record for an item, you will see a box marked "Location".  Here you will find an abbreviation for each library that owns the item in question.  If you are searching the Towers catalog, the abbreviations are for the individual libraries in the Towers group or "cluster".  Member libraries include:</p>

<PRE>    CA      Conception Abbey
    MW      Missouri Western State University
    NMHM	National Military Heritage Museum
    NCMC    North Central Missouri College
    NW      Northwest Missouri State University
</PRE>
If you are searching the comprehensive MOBIUS catalog, you will see 
listings for libraries in all of the clusters statewide.  A list of MOBIUS libraries is
available 
<a href="http://searchmobius.org/screens/libinfo.html">online</a>.

<p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

<a name="view2"><h3>The book I want says the status is "Library Use Only".  Does that mean I can't borrow it?</h3></a>
<p>"Library Use Only" materials are often reference books, rare books, archival documents, or other special materials that the owning library won't lend.  Many of these items can be used by visiting the library that owns them.  For rare books or archival materials, it's a good idea to call ahead to see if special arrangements need to be made.  Often rare books and similar materials are kept in special collections which may have more restricted hours and access policies than the general library.</p>

<p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

<a name="view3"><h3>My instructor wants us to use recently published materials.  How can I tell from my results list when each item was published without having to look at each one individually?</h3></a>
<p>Once you have done a search,  press the "Limit/Sort" button (if available) on the button bar across the top of the screen.  On the page that appears, click in the "Sort results by year" box and press the "Limit/sort items" button below.  Your search results will be redisplayed in publication date order.  The date will be visible to the right of each item listed.</p>
